# memory-game

This project is a set of two games namely a number based memory game and the other a game of hangman made using the C++ concepts learnt in Class 11
The memory game includes generating random numbers and assigning them to random positions in a 4x4 grid. The user has to correctly match the pairs and the score obtained and time taken is stored in a binary file and displayed after sorting it by the score and time taken.
In the game hangman, a random word from a list of words from a binary file is chosen and the user has to guess the word before losing all the 8 lives.
